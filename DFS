The time complexity of DFS traversal is O(V + E), where V and E are the total number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. 
Please note that O(E) may vary between O(1) and O(V2), depending on how dense the graph is.

TREE:
Def: An undirected graph is a tree if it is connected and does not contain a cycle.
